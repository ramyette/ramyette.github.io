<p>
  Welcome to my new blog page!
</p>
<p class="spacer"></p>
<p>
  I'm going to use this page to post updates about my recent
  comptuer science discoveries, new projects, or just whatever is on my mind today.
</p>
<p>
  I am planning on posting frequently to not only share what I've been up to, but motivate
  me to continue working on my personal projects.
</p>
<p class="spacer"></p>
<p>
  Stay tuned for more!

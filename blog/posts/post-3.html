  First, I've not been able to work much on progressing any projects or anything, because my apartment flooded due to
  a pipe bursting in a recent winter storm. So this was actually written about two weeks ago, but I'm finally getting to posting it.

  I've been cooking up a YouTube video for the new ramyette YouTube 
  channel over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ramyette" target="_blank"><img src="/images/youtube.png" width="14"/>youtube.com/ramyette</a>. I started the video in December, but with the semester starting up, I kinda got behind.

  MEGA SPOILER INCOMING: The video is about the development of my first game, titled Plinkobots. It's nothing crazy, 
  but it's my first ever full playable game. It's a recreation of Peggle, which is a game where you drop a ball into 
  a bunch of pegs in order to clear the level. Since you're reading this blog post, you get to know early!

  It's weird how I have the ability to work on personal projects for HOURS on end without even realizing
  time is passing, but then I'm given a data structures and algorithms problem and my motivation is killed.

  I did some research into it and I saw that it has to do with your intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation. When
  I'm working on my own projects, I have some internal desire to complete the project and learn something new,
  but homework is percieved as a restricted task.

  I think that's true, and I think that this is something I can totally work on. I think if I treat the work
  like it's something I'm passionate about (which, at the end of the day, I am passionate about learning 
  new programming techniques), my motivation will be higher to complete my work.

  ANYWAY, I've spent a lot more time playing games and working on video editing instead of programming lately,
  so I don't have any current project updates. But the particle simulator I'm building is getting close! If
  anyone has advice about gas particle interaction, send it to my email (in the footer of the page) because I am
  still doing research on how to make them behave realistically in my program.

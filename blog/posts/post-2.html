  Lately, I've spent a lot of time working with a low-level graphics library called SDL2. I was mainly inspired
  by a YouTuber by the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HirschDaniel" target="_blank">Daniel Hirsch</a>.
  He makes videos of programming different simulations or games from scratch in SDL2, and this made me realize
  that learning stuff like that is more achievable than I thought.

  The graphics library doesn't even have a function for drawing circles. This means that functions such as those
  have to be made by hand. In my paint project, I had a circular brush, and in order to do that, I made a FillCircle
  function that would do this for me:

  It takes in an SDL_Surface, which is basically just the canvas you're drawing to, a circle struct (which I defined
  earlier in the program, it just has x, y, and radius values), and a hex color. I created a rectangle of size {1, 1} that
  fills in a single pixel, and if the pixel is calculated to be inside of the circle, it's filled in.

  With the help of Stack Overflow, I'm seriously making progress on learning SDL2! If you're interested in low-level
  graphics but don't know where to start, I'd definitely say get into SDL. It's honestly super intuitive and they
  have plenty of examples and docs <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Tutorials" target="_blank">here</a>.

  After working on my SDL Paint app, I started to work on a particle simulation. It's currently in the works and will
  be on <a href="/projects/">/projects</a> in the next few days, but it's been a struggle to figure out the right math to
  make them interact like gas particles.

  All of this to say, if you ever look at something and thing it's too complicated to understand, just sit down,
  find some documentation, and start! Once you get going, it just keeps flowing (at least for me).

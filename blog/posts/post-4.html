  THAT'S RIGHT! There is a new project in <a href="/projects/">/projects</a>! I know, I know, some of you have just been 
  waiting on the edge of your seat for weeks for this to drop.

  It's a "particle simulator", but it's veryyyy basic right now. The particles don't yet impact 
  each other at all, and the only impact they have is from user input. But in it's current state, 
  it's more just cool visuals, so I decided to give it its own page to play it online.

  I've been meaning to post this for a while, but I wanted to finish it before posting 
  it. But, I decided to just go ahead and post it while I'm still working on it so that I can have 
  another project on my website.

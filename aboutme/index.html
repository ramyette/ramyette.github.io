    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Rivers Amyette. As I mentioned on the <a href="/">home</a> page,
      I'm a sophomore in the University of South Carolina Honors College studying Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm from Greenville, SC, and I first picked up a programming book (how to write html) when I was 8 years old.
      I made a few websites for fun, but I really got into programming when I started learning C++ in middle school.
      After taking both AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A in high school, I decided to pursue computer science in college.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also participate in the Carolina Band Drumline, where I play quads. I was always in band through school, and
      I played the drums growing up, so joining the drumline was a great way to continue that passion in college while also meeting new people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently, I decided to lock in on game development as my main focus for projects. I enjoy the process of
      creating interactive experiences, and it allows me to combine my childhood passion for gaming with my technical skills.
      I want to create the new generation of games that I would have loved to play growing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently, I've started posting YouTube videos about my development process and projects
      (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ramyette" target="_blank"><img src="/images/youtube.png" width="14"/> youtube.com/ramyette</a>).
      Check that out for a more personal look into my programming journey!
